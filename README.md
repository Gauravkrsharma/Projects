# Projects
##Design and implementation of new secured MODBUS-RTU protocol(Prototype ready) 
•	Key Responsibility: Project manager, ,Solution Architecture
•	Platform: IDE-Code composer studio, Embedded-C
•	Hardware used- microcontroller MSP432P401R,ESP 8266 Wi-Fi module, Digital Panel meter
•	Description: Developed a unique Modbus RTU protocol by using microcontroller MSP432P401R that communicate on serial line usually on MAX485 or RS485 with a panel meter. We have used data loggers at places as RTUs. We also developed intelligent RTUs also which has the compute inbuilt to create a redundant analogy for the implementation of security procedure and command..
